# rock-paper-scissors
I have uploaded my working rock-paper-scissors game. The UI is very barebones but the game:
  1. Lets user know the score
  2. Lets user know what their pick was
  3. Lets user know what computer pick was
  4. Lets user know what round it is
  5. Ends when either the user or the computer reaches 5 round wins
  6. Disables the buttons when the game is over
